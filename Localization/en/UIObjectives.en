It is based on our monitoring of pro-alien groups and visible alien activity in the Solar System.<br/><br/>We believe a large visible space presence, as measured by our Mission Control usage, along with hostile actions we take against the aliens or their proxies on Earth, increases their concerns about us. We expect the aliens may retaliate against our interests on Earth and in space should the threat monitor reach the maximum level. We also suspect they may launch one-off retaliations in response to direct action by our operatives against them, but they may also lose interest if we avoid opposing them or their proxies on Earth directly for a time.<br/><br/>Our analysts emphasize that this will be an imperfect estimate. We will correct our estimates when the aliens take direct action against us or when contacting one of them directly.<br/><br/>The estimate will turn entirely red if we conclude the aliens are in a total war footing against our interests.

UI.Objectives.FleetScreenCanvas.DesignDataShipDV.Name=Delta-V
UI.Objectives.FleetScreenCanvas.DesignDataShipDV.Desc=<h>Delta-V</h>, measured in kps (kilometers per second), is the critical stat for determining where a ship can go and how fast it can get there. Increasing the number of a ship's propellant tanks increases Delta-V, while more mass on a ship decreases it.<br/><br/>As ship drive modules increase their exhaust velocity value, they will expend less propellant to achieve the same thrust.<br/><br/>A ship with less than 8 kps Delta-V may have trouble reaching the Moon from an Earth orbit. A ship with less than 20 kps Delta-V will not be able to reliably perform interplanetary transfers from Earth. Trips to the outer planets or ships intended to maneuver frequently in combat will require more Delta-V. A ship with a low Delta-V capacity may have to wait for a favorable alignment of planets, called a <h>Launch Window</h>, before it can depart.
UI.Objectives.FleetScreenCanvas.DesignDataShipTurnRate.Name=Turn Rate
UI.Objectives.FleetScreenCanvas.DesignDataShipTurnRate.Desc=<h>Turn Rate</h> is how quickly a ship can change its orientation in combat. This value is dependent on the length and mass of the ship; shorter ships will turn faster all things being equal.
UI.Objectives.FleetScreenCanvas.DesignDataShipHeatSink.Name=Heat Sink Capacity

UI.Objectives.NaturalSpaceObjectOps.2.Desc=Various "Mission To ..." global techs unlock parts of the Solar System for exploration. To build bases on the surface of space bodies, you must first prospect the body with a probe or a properly equipped fleet to learn about potential base sites.<br/><br/>You may launch probes via the <h>Launch Prospector Probe</h> operation here, or within the <h>Solar System tab in the Intel window</h>. Probes can either come from Earth or a nearby hab's <color=#FFFFFFFF><sprite name=construction_shipyard></color> shipyard, if you have built one.
UI.Objectives.NaturalSpaceObjectOps.3.Name=Founding Habs
UI.Objectives.NaturalSpaceObjectOps.3.Desc=With the appropriate research unlocked for construction and exploration, we can also found <h>Habs</h> (stations and bases) at this location via launches from Earth or from other nearby habitats with construction modules. When using Boost, travel time from Earth is included, so these may take some time to complete construction for distant objects.

UI.Objectives.ArmyOps.1.Name=Army Operations
UI.Objectives.ArmyOps.1.NameShort=Armies
UI.Objectives.ArmyOps.1.Desc=Armies represent large expeditionary forces able to seize enemy territory. They are controlled from these panels.<br/><br/>Operations available to armies here when an army we control is selected. Army control comes from owning the Control Point the army is associated with.<br/><br/>The primary army action is the "Deploy Army," operation, which will allow you to move it to any legal region on Earth. Legal regions are other regions in its home nation, allied nations, or nations at war with its home nation that it can reach. Once they arrive, armies will battle enemy armies and region defenses and occupy enemy territory automatically.<br/><br/>They may also cross bodies of water if they have an attached navy and their nation is not blockaded at sea by its enemies.<br/><br/>Armies and navies cost Investment Points to maintain, but the cost is discounted if they are stationed in their home region.

UI.Objectives.ArmyOps.2.Name=Army Operations
UI.Objectives.ArmyOps.2.Desc=Certain army operations allow the selected army to target specific locations in a region. Hover over or click on an operation to view that operation's details.

UI.Objectives.FleetOps.1.Name=Fleet Operations
UI.Objectives.FleetOps.1.NameShort=Fleets
UI.Objectives.FleetOps.1.Desc=<h>Operations</h> available to fleets we control appear here when a fleet is selected. The available operations may vary widely depending on what modules are equipped on ships within the fleet. These include founding habs, orbital bombardment, transferring officers and propellant between ships, landing on planetary surfaces, or resupplying at a hab.<br/><br/>Some fleet operations have a duration that will cause the fleet to be unavailable until the operation is completed or aborted.<br/><br/>

UI.Objectives.FleetOps.2.Name=Transfer Operation
UI.Objectives.FleetOps.2.Desc=The <h>Transfer</h> operation allows us to move our fleet to another orbit, station, or fleet. Selecting this operation opens the trajectory planner.<br/><br/>Transferring to an enemy fleet or a station that is defended by a fleet or defensive modules will initiate <h>space combat</h> once our fleet reaches the target. If an enemy station is undefended, our fleet will automatically dock upon arrival and may conduct additional operations there.

UI.Objectives.TransferOp.1.Name=Trajectory Planning
UI.Objectives.TransferOp.1.NameShort=Transfers
UI.Objectives.TransferOp.1.Desc=These panels comprise the <h>Trajectory Planner</h> and allow us to send one of our fleets to another orbit, station, or fleet.<br/><br/>You can change the fleet's destination via the list menu above or by selecting a transfer target in the Solar System view.

UI.Objectives.TransferOp.6.Name=Thrust Profiles
UI.Objectives.TransferOp.6.Desc=If our ships' propulsion systems are sufficiently capable to allow it, selecting a transfer target will generate one or more candidate transfers for our fleet. The <h>Trajectory Planner</h> shows these options.<br/><br/>The options are generated from the lowest acceleration and lowest Delta-V among all ships in the fleet, and adding or releasing ships from a fleet may change its performance.<br/><br/>For interplanetary travel, the options may vary greatly depending on the current and future positions of the origin and destination, and in some cases it may be ideal to wait for a more favorable alignment, called a "launch window," to save Delta-V. The planner will include options with a "loiter" time at the origin that incorporate this.

UI.Objectives.TransferOp.2.Name=Delta-V
UI.Objectives.TransferOp.2.Desc=Transfers consume a fleet's Delta-V, which is a measure of how much our ships can change their velocity before exhausting their supply of propellant. This functions as a measure of the ship's range; insufficient Delta-V can prevent the fleet from escaping local gravity, or cause the transfer to be so slow as to be untenable.<br/><br/>If multiple candidate transfers are available between our fleet's current location and chosen destination, a slider will appear here. It allows you to trade off Delta-V and travel duration.<br/><br/>While choosing a Thrust Profile, the flight path will be displayed in the Solar System view.

UI.Objectives.TransferOp.3.Name=Delta-V Management
UI.Objectives.TransferOp.3.Desc=Fleets can resupply at habs with <color=#FFFFFFFF><sprite name=construction_shipyard></color> Shipyards or <color=#FFFFFFFF><sprite name=supply></color> Supply Depot modules. Make sure our fleets retain enough Delta-V to get to one. You may also want to preserve more Delta-V if you are expecting the fleet to enter combat.

UI.Objectives.TransferOp.4.Name=Special Maneuvers
UI.Objectives.TransferOp.4.Desc=You can also set one of two special maneuvers for our trajectory.<br/><br/><h>Aerobraking</h> is only possible at space bodies with atmospheres, but lets you save Delta-V by braking against an atmosphere to decelerate. It also risks damage to our ships if they are not built for this sort of maneuver.<br/><br/><h>Fly-by</h> maneuvers order our fleet to not slow down to stop at the target destination, but instead use it for a gravity assist. You will be prompted to select a new destination upon arrival.

UI.Objectives.TransferOp.5.Name=Space Combat
UI.Objectives.TransferOp.5.Desc=Sending our fleet on a trajectory to fleets of another faction is one way to engage in space combat. When our fleet arrives at an enemy fleet, or vice versa, you will be prompted to: <h>Engage</h> the enemy fleet in combat, <h>Accept</h> combat if the enemy chooses to engage, or attempt to <h>Evade</h> combat.

UI.Objectives.SpaceBodyDetail.1.Name=Space Body Details

This includes the space body's physical data, mining potential of the body, the current population stationed at the space body, and the hab tier that it can support.<br/><br/>Space bodies with higher gravity and escape velocity values cause the cost of constructing mines and launching ships from the surface to be more expensive.

UI.Objectives.SpaceBodyDetail.2.Name=Mining Potential
UI.Objectives.SpaceBodyDetail.2.Desc=Estimates of how much solar energy is available at a space body as well as space resources available from its surface are displayed here. Each meter indicates a measure of abundance, a "?" indicates only the possible presence of the resource, and an absent meter indicates the resource is not present. Uninhabitable space bodies will not have resources available for mining.

UI.Objectives.SpaceBodyDetail.3.Name=Orbits
UI.Objectives.SpaceBodyDetail.3.Desc=Select this tab to view a list of orbits around the space body. Orbits serve as locations for building stations and destinations for fleet transfers.<br/><br/>To have a fleet land at a base on the space body, it must first transfer to an interface orbit which is marked with an icon of the space body. Docking at a station requires the fleet to be in the same orbit as the station.

UI.Objectives.SpaceBodyDetail.4.Name=Hab Sites
UI.Objectives.SpaceBodyDetail.4.Desc=If a space body is habitable, a list of hab sites can be viewed by clicking on the "Sites" tab. Sites are locations on the space body where a faction may build a base. Once the space body has been surveyed, the exact incomes from its hab sites will be displayed here. Once a base is built at a site, it will be marked with a faction icon to display which faction controls it.

UI.Objectives.LagrangePoint.1.Name=Lagrange Point Details
UI.Objectives.LagrangePoint.1.NameShort=L-Points

UI.Tutorial.VO.1=Greetings Commander, I am Fiona Ayoade, your chief of staff. I'll be briefing you on the situation.
UI.Tutorial.VO.2=Our council is made up of some of the Earth's best and brightest. They are capable, connected and standing by for your orders.
UI.Tutorial.VO.3=If we truly face the threat of invasion, we need to start organizing now. We are going to need global cooperation on a never-before-seen scale. I recommend we start tasking our councilors with gaining support in strategic positions of power across the globe.
UI.Tutorial.VO.4=Reports are still coming in but it is clear that an alien object has crashed down on the planet. We should send a councilor to investigate the site as soon as possible.
UI.Tutorial.VO.5=This is your main command interface. From here we can monitor developments across the globe and beyond; send our councilors on missions; direct research and development; and much more. Take some time to familiarize yourself with it.
UI.Tutorial.VO.6=Information about our currently selected councilor appears in the bottom-right of the screen. Their available missions can be found in the bottom-center of the screen.
UI.Tutorial.VO.7=It will be critical for us to not lose sight of our goals. I will keep this screen updated with our current objectives.

UI.Tutorial.VO.10a=This is the Tech Tree. Our researchers have extrapolated out what different scientific breakthroughs could lead to.
UI.Tutorial.VO.10b=This is the Tech Tree. Our researchers have extrapolated out what different scientific breakthroughs could lead to. Frankly, Commander, if I look at it too long I get a headache, and they say this is the simple one.
UI.Tutorial.VO.10c=And this, is the "complete" one…
UI.Tutorial.VO.10d=Commander, you have been staring at the tech tree for a while. How about a cup of coffee?
UI.Tutorial.VO.10e=This is the list of all the council engineering projects we can pursue at this time.
UI.Tutorial.VO.10f=These are the research archives where we can find reports on our completed research.
UI.Tutorial.VO.11=Our councilor has gained the support of people in key positions of power in a nation. We should consider what our priorities are for that nation.
UI.Tutorial.VO.12=Our current councilors are stretched thin. I recommend we expand the council.
UI.Tutorial.VO.13=As we expand our operations, we will soon need the support of a large nation.
UI.Tutorial.VO.14=We should make every effort to understand a nation's social and economic situation so we can best direct its development to support our efforts.
UI.Tutorial.VO.15=A nation's priorities determine how it will develop over time. As we gain control points in a nation, we can direct more of its priorities.
UI.Tutorial.VO.16=Remember Commander, we have enemies out there, and not just extraterrestrial ones.
UI.Tutorial.VO.17=Commander, I'd like to introduce you to the Council. Take some time to familiarize yourself with our councilors. They are the backbone of our organization.
UI.Tutorial.VO.17a=This is our councilor's dossier. Here you can view a councilor's missions, attributes, traits, monthly incomes and organizations. Different types of councilors will be able to conduct different types of missions.
UI.Tutorial.VO.17b=I have compiled dossiers on potential councilor candidates for you to review. Commander, other factions have footholds in many of Earth's nations. If necessary, our councilors can move to root them out.
UI.Tutorial.VO.18=In the worst cases our only option might be declaring war and imposing a complete regime change on another nation.
UI.Tutorial.VO.19=This is the Intel Screen. It holds all of the intelligence data we have gathered and covers a wide range of topics. Here you can see what information we have gathered so far on the other major factions operating on Earth.

UI.Tutorial.VO.24=Commander, we are getting reports of an alien ship on its way to Earth.
UI.Tutorial.VO.25=Commander, our contributions to global research have given us the opportunity to steer the scientific community's efforts. What are your orders?
UI.Tutorial.VO.26=Research stations, space docks, resupply hubs, we are going to need it all. When you think we are ready, take the leap into orbit.
UI.Tutorial.VO.27=Our station will be useless without a power generation solution.
UI.Tutorial.VO.28=Time to put our station to work.
UI.Tutorial.VO.29=We are going to need extensive mining operations to support a fleet. Launching a probe will help us gain vital prospecting data.
UI.Tutorial.VO.30=Mining complexes are your primary means of acquiring space resources, which means we won't have to use expensive rockets launched from Earth to build habitats and spacecraft.
UI.Tutorial.VO.31=We will need to build a space dock if we are to start building a war fleet.
UI.Tutorial.VO.32=Finally, we get to build something with a little punch.
UI.Tutorial.VO.33=The war against the aliens can't be won on Earth alone. We should continue constructing warships to defend against and eventually attack the aliens.
UI.Tutorial.VO.34=This is the Habs Screen. From here we can manage our orbital stations and any bases we have on planets, moons, or asteroids. Additionally, we can view any other stations or bases we have discovered.
UI.Tutorial.VO.35=This is the Fleets Screen. From here we can monitor both our own fleets and any other fleets we have detected.
UI.Tutorial.VO.36=From the ship designer we can design new ship classes or plan to refit ships we have already built.
UI.Tutorial.VO.36a=Ships that you design will appear here. We can order ships to be constructed at habs with construction facilities.
